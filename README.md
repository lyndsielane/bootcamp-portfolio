## Lyndsie Lane's Portfolio

* The site is branded with shaded of teal and red, and utilizes two fonts. The hero image was chosen for it's match to Lyndsie's personality. The color codes were pulled directly from the image.
* The hero header contains a logo and a navigation bar that will quickly direct a user to the coordinating sections of the page. As the user scrolls, the hero image shrinks and the top nav sticks to the top of the page as it neatly meets the main content of the page. This allows the nav options to be readily available whenever the user needs them. Mobile utilization is used to ensure this works on all screen sizes. When a screen is small enough, the navigation options change to a hamburger menu so the bar doesn't get crowded.
* Underneath the header and contact bar is a quick introduction to Lyndsie with a short bio and portrait. Mobile features are enabled for this to automatically shrink and stack as required based on screen size.
* Just below the intro is a skills section. It features color coordinated icons of Lyndsie's skills and a fun animation when the screen is clicked.
* Under the skills is a My Work section that includes a set of project cards. Currently there are four cards with featured projects that I hope to quickly expand. Each card shows a project screenshot, title, and small description. The cards have two buttons, one that links to the Github repo and one that links to the deployed site or the app preview video. The cards will shrink and stack as needed for smaller screen sizes.
* Under the cards is a Contact Me section that matches the skill section styling. It includes icons that allow a user to call or email me, find me on Github or LinkedIn, and download my resume.
* Scrolling to the bottom of the page presents a footer.

    The site is deployed at https://lyndsielane.github.io/lyndsie-lane-portfolio/
