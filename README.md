* The site is branded with two main colors and three fonts. All photos were chosen to closely match the branding.
* The header contains a nav bar, background photo, self-portrait, title, and subtitle.
* The nav bar links to the appropriate section within the website. The resume tab is currently a placeholder that will open a PDF once my resume is up to date.
* The About Me section is a short introduction to my experience and what I am looking for once my job search begins.
* The Work section contains photos with links to projects. Currently all but two are placeholders. The opaque overlay on these sections disappears upon hover. The photos are currently stock photos used as fillers, once final projects are in place they will be replaced with photos to match the assigned project.
* The Contact Me section contains my phone number, email, Github, and LinkedIn. Each of these is a link to the appropriate place.
* The site adjusts and shrinks for smaller screen sizes.

    The site is deployed at https://lyndsielane.github.io/lyndsie-lane-portfolio/
