## lyndsie-lane-portfolio

* The site is branded with two main colors and two fonts. The hero header was chosen for it's match to Lyndsie's style and the color scheme of the portfolio.
* The header is followed by a contact bar with clickable links for several forms of contact for Lyndsie. These links open in new pages.
* Underneath the header and contact bar is a quick introduction to me. There is a short bio and portrait.
* Just below the intro are feature cards for projects. Each card has a screenshot of the application, a title, a blurb about the app, and a more details link.
* The more details link opens a new page with full details of the project. These pages contain a larger screenshot of the application, a description of why a user would want to use the app, and developer details for the app. There is a link to the deployed site as well as a link to the Github repo.
* The style of all pages is the same. The header, contact bar, and footer are on all pages.
* The site adjusts and shrinks for smaller screen sizes.

    The site is deployed at https://lyndsielane.github.io/lyndsie-lane-portfolio/
