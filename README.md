* The header contains a nav bar, background photo, self-portrait, title, and subtitle
* The nav bar links to the appropriate section within the website. The resume tab is currently a placeholder that will open a PDF once my resume is up to date
* The About Me section is a short introduction to my experience and what I am looking for once my job search begins
* The Work section contains photos with links to projects. Currently all but two are placeholders. The opaque overlay on these sections disappears upon hover
* The Contact Me section contains my phone number, email, Github, and LinkedIn. Each of these is a link to the appropriate place.
* Everything adjusts and shrinks for smaller screen sizes
