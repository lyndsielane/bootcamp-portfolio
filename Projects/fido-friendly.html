        <div class="fido-details"><p>Ready for a movie night but don't want to traumatize your dog? Fido Friendly is here for you!
            Enter the movie title you want to watch and Fido Friendly will give you all the information you need and also lets you know if there are any dog fatalities you should protect your companion from before settling in for your movie date!
            Make sure your movie choice is safe for you and your dog with a single click!
            Stay tuned for further app developments.
            The website uses OMDB and Does the Dog Die APIs to provide the information in a user friendly way. OMDB is used to pull the basic movie information including the title, plot, movie poster, release date, genre, movie rating, runtime, and review score. Does the Dog Die is used to inform the user whether or not there is a dog that perishes in the movie, allowing the user to know if it is safe to watch with their dog. There is a carousel header suggesting dog friendly movies if a user needs ideas to begin their movie night. An easily accessible search bar to enter the name of a movie. The information for the movie is then inserted into a previously hidden section. Previously searched movies are stored in a search history dropdown that is accessed through the navigation bar. The search history is clickable should a user want to see the results again to aid in their decision on which movie to watch.</p></div>
