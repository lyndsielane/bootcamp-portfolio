            Need a simple way to keep track of your daily tasks and meetings? Look no further than this Work Day Scheduler. Add your tasks to the timeblocks when you begin your day. Tasks are easy to add, edit, and delete in case your plans change. The time blocks are color coded to indicate if they are past (grey), present (red), or future (green) to give you a perfect overview of your accomplishments and what remains for the day. The next day, you will return to a blank page ready for your new tasks and goals. Planning one day at a time keeps it simple and allows more space for you to focus on what matters most.

            HTML, CSS, and JS were used to make this scheduler. The application uses moment to pull the users date and time by location. Local Storage is utilized to store the events even if a user strays from the page. The design was kept to a minimum to ensure a simple, non-distracting interface for the user.
